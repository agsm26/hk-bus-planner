/* 香港快線 — service worker.
   =========================================================================
   This is the file that makes the app installable and lets it open without a
   connection. It sits between the app and the network and decides, for every
   single request, whether a stored copy may be used.

   THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS: a stored answer must never be able to lie to
   someone standing at a bus stop.

   So requests fall into three groups, and the group decides everything:

     NEVER STORED   arrival times, weather warnings, place search, holidays.
                    A four-minute countdown from yesterday is worse than no
                    countdown at all — the whole point of this app is that an
                    older rider can trust what it says. These go straight to
                    the network; if there is no network the app says so.

     NEVER STORED   map tiles and the Lands Department logo.
                    Not for safety — for licensing. The tiles are free to use
                    live from the Lands Department's own service, and this
                    project's rule has always been to drop anything whose
                    terms are not plainly clear. Keeping a private copy of a
                    map is a different thing from displaying it, so we don't.
                    The visible result: OFFLINE THE MAP IS BLANK. That is a
                    deliberate trade, and the app says so in plain words.

     STORED         the page, the icons, Leaflet, and the route/fare/station
                    files sitting beside this one. None of it changes during
                    a journey, all of it is needed before anything works.

   WHAT THIS MEANS OFFLINE
   The app opens, remembers your favourites, plans a journey from stored route
   data, and shows fares and station names. It cannot show live arrivals, the
   weather, or the map. That is a real, useful subset — planning "which bus do
   I take" works on the MTR platform with no signal.

   HOW TO PUSH AN UPDATE
   Change VERSION below. Browsers re-check this file on every page load and
   install the new one the moment its bytes differ, so a new VERSION both
   changes the bytes and gives the new cache a new name. The app then shows
   the rider a "new version — tap to update" button rather than reloading
   underneath them, which on a phone could throw away a journey they are
   halfway through reading.
